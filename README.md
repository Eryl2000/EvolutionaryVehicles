# EvolutionaryVehicles
Creatures with movement and sensing traits face off in an evolutionary survival test.

Each creature has sensing distance, attraction/repulsion to food, attraction/repulsion to poison, and health. Over time, creatures lose health. Food gives them health, and poison removes health. To survive, creatures must continuously find and eat food. When a creature dies, a piece of food is created at their location (to help stabilize food supply). Poison is added periodically as well.

Every so often creatures can reproduce. They do this by spawning a copy of themselves (with a chance of mutations). Creatures with higher health reproduce at a higher rate, thus rewarding them for superior traits.

Eventually, only excellent food seekers with sensible poison aviodance remain (or are eveloved into).
